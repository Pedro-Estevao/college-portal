## üìö About the Project
This repository contains a **Student & Teacher Portal Clone**, developed as part of an assignment for the **Programming Techniques 1** course in the **Computer Science** program at **Centro Universit√°rio Bar√£o de Mau√°**, under the guidance of professor **Thiago Nicola Cajuela Garcia**.

The project was built using **PHP (Object-Oriented Programming)** and **MySQL**, aiming to replicate the common functionalities of an academic portal with a more consistent layout.

## üí° Project Overview
The portal follows the standard structure of a university system, featuring two primary user roles:

- **Students**: Can submit assignments and exams, view grades, and track their academic progress.
- **Teachers**: Can create assignments and exams, review submissions, and grade students.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Note
This was one of my **first academic projects**, developed early in my university studies. Although I had prior experience with this tech stack from my technical course, I didn't continue working on this project due to my focus on learning other programming languages. However, it remains available for anyone interested in studying **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in PHP**.
